# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Tree is combination of nodes connected with each other ,  node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. and Create a Binary Tree class and create methods for each of the depth first traversals such as `pre order` and `in order` `post order`  and define a class for Binary Search Tree

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

* time and complexity for (bfs) method: O(n)

* time complexity for (pre_order) methods: O(n)

* O time complexity for (in_order) method: O(n)

* O time complexity for (post_order): O(n)
