# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Tree is combination of nodes connected with each other ,  node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create Breadth-first Traversal for binary tree , which takes in a tree as argument , and return a list of all values in the tree

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

* time and complexity for (breadth_first) method: O(n)
