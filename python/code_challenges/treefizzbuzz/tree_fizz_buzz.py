    Determines whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.
    Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
    If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
