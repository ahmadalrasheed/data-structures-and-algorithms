A Tree is combination of nodes connected with each other ,  node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. and Create a Binary Tree class and create methods for each of the depth first traversals such as `pre order` and `in order` `post order`  and define a class for Binary Search Tree
