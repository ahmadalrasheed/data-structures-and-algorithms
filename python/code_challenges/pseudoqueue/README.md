O complexity for (PseudoQueue.queue) method: O(n)

O complexity for (PseudoQueue.dequeue) method: O(n)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->


>enqueue:"""
        This method Inserts value into the PseudoQueue
        Arguments:
        value: any
        """

>dequeue:"""
        This method Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue
        Arguments: None
        Return: Value of Dequeued Node
        """
